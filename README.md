I referred to the python code and rewrote it in Java. This includes common optimization algorithms. For example, steepest descent, conjugate gradient BFGS and L_BFGS. I have given specific verification cases for reference.

The source of the python code is: https://github.com/yrlu/non-convex/blob/master/non-convex.py.
